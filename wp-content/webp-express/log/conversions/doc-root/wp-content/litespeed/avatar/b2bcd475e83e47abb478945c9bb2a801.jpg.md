The following options have been set explicitly. Note: it is the resulting options after merging down the "jpeg" and "png" options and any converter-prefixed options.
- source: [doc-root]/wp-content/litespeed/avatar/b2bcd475e83e47abb478945c9bb2a801.jpg
- destination: [doc-root]/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/doc-root/wp-content/litespeed/avatar/b2bcd475e83e47abb478945c9bb2a801.jpg.webp
- default-quality: 70
- encoding: "auto"
- log-call-arguments: true
- max-quality: 80
- metadata: "none"
- quality: "auto"

The following options have not been explicitly set, so using the following defaults:
- alpha-quality: 85
- auto-filter: false
- low-memory: false
- method: 6
- skip: false

The following options were supplied but are ignored because they are not supported by this converter:
- near-lossless
------------

Encoding is set to auto - converting to both lossless and lossy and selecting the smallest file

Converting to lossy
Quality of source is 90. This is higher than max-quality, so using max-quality instead (80)
Reduction: 82% (went from 1528 bytes to 268 bytes)

Converting to lossless
Reduction: -10% (went from 1528 bytes to 1676 bytes)

Picking lossy
imagick succeeded :)

Converted image in 2722 ms, reducing file size with 82% (went from 1528 bytes to 268 bytes)
